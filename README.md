# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

In this project, an ETL pipeline was built using Python, Pandas, and pgAdmin4. Data was extracted from two CSV files, crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx, and transformed into structured DataFrames for categories, subcategories, campaigns, and contacts.


The transformed data was exported to CSV files for easy handling and verification.
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was created to visualize the data relationships, and a corresponding database schema was defined to structure the tables in a PostgreSQL database.

Lastly, the CSV files were loaded into the pgAdmin4 database, ensuring that the data was accurately stored and ready for further analysis and querying.
